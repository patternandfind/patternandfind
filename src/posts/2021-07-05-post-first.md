Hello!

We are Kellen and Claire and Sadie. This is our new project. It's called pattern+find. The name is based on the writings of Ursula K. LeGuin and the world of Earthsea.
In particalur the characters of Ember and Otter, who are respectively very good patterners and very good finders.


This project is an exploration into the great digital and non-digital unknown. It's a bit like the starship Enterprise, and we are its crew. A couple of super intelligent
and kind beings, who are good at solving impossible problems. Sadie is our Data. She is a good dog, who acts like a cat sometimes. She is a good, pretty dog with lots of 
spots. You will see plenty more of her perfect little face.

Through this project, we will be going where no one has gone before while travelling through time and space and digital networks. You will find posts on just about everything.
We'll be looking at how to preserve our personal records. We'll be testing out cool and open-source technologies. We'll be reflexively looking to our pasts to inform 
the kind of feminist decolonial socialist present we hope to see on earth. We'll be documenting our travels and journeys like Frodo and Sam. 
And of course there will be plenty of Sadie pictures.
