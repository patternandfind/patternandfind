Hello, and welcome to Claire's first post on the Pattern and Find blog!
Mr. Kettenburg, my highschool AP U.S. History and Economics teacher, taught me to always begin my essays with a map. This not only helped readers, but helped me, the writer, too. To know where we're going, and when.  So, in this blog post I plan to travel to the following places:
- Why please + flourish? 
- Decolonization, courage, healing and me
- Too long, didn't read
- Some future plans for pattern + find
  - Blog plans
  - Collections plans
  - Other plans
