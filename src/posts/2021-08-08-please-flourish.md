Hello, and welcome to Claire's first post on the Pattern and Find blog!
Mr. Kettenburg, my highschool AP U.S. History and Economics teacher, taught me to always begin my essays with a map. This not only helped readers, but helped me, the writer, too. To know where we're going, and when.  So, in this blog post I plan to travel to the following places:
- Why please + flourish?
- Picking up the work of decolonization
- Too long, didn't read
- Some future plans for pattern + find
  - Blog plans
  - Collections plans
  - Other plans

## Why **please** + *flourish*?

When we first came up with the name, pattern and find, we then started to think of all sorts of other combinations of words that started with p and f that seemed to meld together quite nicely! These are too much fun to give up, and so the plan is to title each general blog post with one of these p and f combinations. 

Today, as I was journaling about pattern and find-- the kind of space I want it to be, the kinds of things I want to grow there-- the words 'please' and 'flourish' came to me. 

**Please** because I am learning to ask myself nicely to spend time on the things that nurture me, water me, give me sunlight and song. Many things within me are now seeds, just like pattern + find, but I hope someday they will be a garden, a grove, an orchard, a forest. Please, I am learning to say to myself, after reading 'The Artist's Way', and realizing how true it is that the part of me who makes things, who creates and imagines, needs to be treated with immense kindness and with sweet words. Please, claire, I say to myself, spend time in this secret soil, see what's living, and help it thrive!

**Please** also because I find it pleasing to work on this, in this space. It please me, and I want it to please others as well. To be aesthetically pleasing in its design, and pleasing in its content. To bring joy, and healing, and much needed shade to hot places, water to dry ones, etc. 

And *flourish*? Flourish-- because I am already overwhelmed, in this very paragraph, by how much there is that I want to do here, to grow, to plant. To tend to, and be responsible for. Letting it be alright, even, wonderful, that there's place for all that to flourish. Not just grow, but really grow-- to jurassic park, mammoth, land-before-time sizes, to invite diverse forms and content, to let it be over-the-top, and teeming with life, and everything-just-so, and also, to be functional and fun. 

Alright, so that's a lot of metaphors, you might be thinking! What's this whole 'pattern + find' project *really* about? What's the point? And why the blog? 

Well why don't we open this ivy covered door, and walk together down this growing path. I'll tell you all I know about this place so far, which is some. But I also have so much to learn...

## Picking up the work of decolonization
